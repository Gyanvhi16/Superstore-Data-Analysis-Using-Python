# Superstore-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
A comprehensive data analysis and visualization project using the Superstore dataset. This repository demonstrates various data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Seaborn.

**Overview**:  

1. **Objective**:  
   - To analyze the Superstore dataset for insights such as sales trends, profit analysis, product performance, and customer behavior.  
   - To identify patterns and trends in order priorities, shipping modes, product categories, and more.

2. **Key Features**:  
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and inconsistencies (e.g., filling missing `Product Base Margin` values, correcting `Order Priority` data).  
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Count plots and pie charts for features like `Order Priority`, `Ship Mode`, and `Customer Segment`.  
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships, such as profit across product categories and sub-categories.  
   - **Time-Series Analysis**: Sales and order trends by year.  
   - **Geographical Analysis**: Identify states with maximum and minimum sales.  
   - **Profit Analysis**: Insights into product margins and categories contributing to profit.  

3. **Visualizations**:  
   - Bar plots, pie charts, and count plots to represent data distribution.  
   - Yearly trends and category-specific analysis to uncover actionable insights.  

4. **Libraries Used**:  
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.  
   - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for creating visually appealing plots.  
   - `numpy` for numerical operations.  

5. **Usage**:  
   - Clone the repository and execute the notebook or script to reproduce the results.  
   - Use the visualizations to identify trends and patterns in the Superstore dataset.  

6. **Potential Extensions**:  
   - Include machine learning models for sales prediction or customer segmentation.  
   - Integrate geographical visualizations using `folium` or `plotly`.
